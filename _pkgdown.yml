reference:
  - title: Statistics Functions
    desc: Statistics functions should do the computation of the numbers that are tabulated later.
          In order to separate computation from formatting, they should not take care of `rcell` type
          formatting themselves.
    contents:
      - s_mmrm_lsmeans
      - s_mmrm_lsmeans_single

  - title: Formatted Analysis functions
    desc: These have the same arguments as the corresponding statistics functions, and can be further
          customized by calling `rtables::make_afun()` on them. They are used as `afun` in
          `rtables::analyze()`.
    contents:
       - a_mmrm_lsmeans
       - a_mmrm_lsmeans_single

  - title: Analyze Functions
    desc: Analyze Functions are used in combination with the rtables layout functions, in the pipeline which creates
          the table.
